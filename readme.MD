# RUST CHAT

## How does it work ?

Launch the database (go to rust_chat folder): 
- docker-compose up 

Server connection (go to server folder) :
- cargo run

Client connection (when the server is launch go to client folder) :
- cargo run
  
Now, you can enter a name, gender and password. When your register you can chat with your friends and see the messages on the server terminal.


Ifg you want to see the data, you can have a software like Robo 3T to show the data in the database.
